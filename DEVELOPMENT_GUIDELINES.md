# Development Guidelines

This document outlines the development practices and guidelines for the ArchivesSpace Azure deployment project.

## üöÄ Commit Practices

### When to Commit

- **Major refactoring** (e.g., inlining scripts, restructuring code)
- **New features** (e.g., adding Fedora integration, new scripts)
- **Bug fixes** (e.g., fixing configuration issues, dependency problems)
- **Documentation updates** (e.g., README changes, new guides)
- **Infrastructure changes** (e.g., VM specs, network configuration)

### Commit Message Format

```
Type: Brief description of changes

Detailed explanation of what was changed and why:

CORE CHANGES:
- Specific changes made
- Files modified/added/deleted
- New functionality added

BENEFITS:
‚úÖ Benefit 1

```

### Commit Message Examples

#### For Refactoring:

```
Refactor: Inline all installation scripts using Terraform locals

Major project reorganization to improve maintainability and deployment:

CORE CHANGES:
- Converted all external .sh files to Terraform locals in main.tf
- Eliminated external dependencies for cleaner deployment
- Added Fedora integration as automatic VM extension

BENEFITS:
‚úÖ Self-contained: All config in single main.tf file
‚úÖ Zero external dependencies: No separate .sh files
‚úÖ Version controlled: Scripts versioned with Terraform code
‚úÖ Easier deployment: One command deploys everything

DEPLOYMENT:
- ArchivesSpace v4.1.1 with official Docker configuration
- Fedora 6.4.0 digital repository with ActiveMQ 5.15.9
- Complete integration between ArchivesSpace and Fedora
```

#### For New Features:

```
Feature: Add Fedora digital repository integration

Added complete digital object management capabilities:

CORE CHANGES:
- Added Fedora 6.4.0 container with ActiveMQ 5.15.9
- Created integration script for ArchivesSpace-Fedora connection
- Added digital objects configuration and setup scripts
- Updated network security groups for Fedora ports

BENEFITS:
‚úÖ Digital object storage and management
‚úÖ Scalable digital repository architecture
‚úÖ Integration with ArchivesSpace workflows
‚úÖ Message queue for reliable processing

DEPLOYMENT:
- Automatic installation via VM extension
- Manual setup available via extract-scripts.sh
- Access Fedora at http://<IP>:8086/fcrepo/rest
```

#### For Bug Fixes:

```
Fix: Resolve nginx proxy configuration issues

Fixed routing problems between nginx and ArchivesSpace containers:

CORE CHANGES:
- Updated nginx configuration to properly route /staff/ requests

- Corrected proxy_pass directives
- Added proper error handling

BENEFITS:
‚úÖ Staff interface now accessible at root URL
‚úÖ Proper routing between public and staff interfaces
‚úÖ Resolved 502 Bad Gateway errors
‚úÖ Improved error handling and logging

DEPLOYMENT:
- Changes applied automatically via VM extension
- No manual intervention required
- Test staff interface at http://<IP>/staff/
```

## üìÅ Project Structure Guidelines

### File Organization

```
terraform-mainifest/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf                    # Main Terraform configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                  # Project documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md  # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extract-scripts.sh         # Helper scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore                 # Git ignore rules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.tfstate*         # State files (gitignored)
```

### Code Organization in main.tf

```hcl
# =============================================================================
# LOCALS - All installation scripts inlined
# =============================================================================
locals {
  # Script 1: Core installation
  install_archivesspace = <<-EOT
    #!/bin/bash
    # Script content
  EOT

  # Script 2: Additional features
  install_fedora = <<-EOT
    #!/bin/bash
    # Script content
  EOT
}

# =============================================================================
# RESOURCES
# =============================================================================
# Infrastructure resources...

# =============================================================================
# VM EXTENSIONS
# =============================================================================
# VM extensions using locals...

# =============================================================================
# OUTPUTS
# =============================================================================
# Output values...
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. Planning

- Document the change/feature requirements
- Plan the implementation approach
- Consider impact on existing functionality

### 2. Implementation

- Make changes following the established patterns
- Test locally if possible
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Testing

- Verify changes work as expected
- Test deployment process
- Check all endpoints and functionality

### 4. Committing

- Stage all relevant changes
- Write comprehensive commit message
